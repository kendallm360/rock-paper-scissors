# rock-paper-scissors

### The spec for this project:
Now that you’ve got the main foundations down to build out a frontend application, it’s time to prove to yourself that you own those skills! You’re going to be building a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch!

### Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical         challenge
