# rock-paper-scissors

### The spec for this project:
Now that you’ve got the main foundations down to build out a frontend application, it’s time to prove to yourself that you own those skills! You’re going to be building a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch!

### Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical         challenge

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Features 
- The user can select between two different game modes.
- Each mode has a variation of weapons the user can choose from.
- After a selection has been made the user will initiate a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer.
- The winner will be displayed, the score will be updated, and the game will reset for another round. 

### Challenges
- The first challenge was figuring out how to, where to, and what to test in order to trace the logic that I had built. 
- Understanding the interaction between classes and their parameters when building the logic for changing screens.

### Wins
- I still feel strong with the html and css.  I also like (interacting with the DOM?) with query selectors and event listeners. I like that there is a general set path of logic to follow so it was easier for me to pick up on this concept.

### Visualization
- See a demo of the app [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/82DQgHqYBNrechqKGS/giphy.gif)

### Potential Additional Features
- The option to make a new character
- The option to change player avatar
- The option to reset score
